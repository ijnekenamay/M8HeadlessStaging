# M8 Headless Staging

![Design Sketch](https://github.com/ijnekenamay/M8HeadlessStaging/raw/main/head.jpg)
This is a DIY project to push the [Dirtywave M8 Headless](https://github.com/Dirtywave/M8HeadlessFirmware) into a PCB and make it handheld.
Test build was done on the fabricated PCB. MIDI I/O AUDIO OUT seems to be working well.
Kicad data has been withheld from the public due to criticism that it would damage the market. Please contact.

## Build
# Parts list
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+(Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is better)
- Teensy 4.1
- Display for the Raspberry Pi (You can find them at [Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000380101537.html))
- pcm5102dac decorder (You can find them at [Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002898278583.html))
- Kailh Low profile key switch (You can find them at [Aliexpress](https://ja.aliexpress.com/item/32959996455.html))

## Design Outline

![Design Sketch](https://github.com/ijnekenamay/M8HeadlessStaging/raw/main/image1.jpg)

- M8 Headless will be installed on teensy4.1.
- The client software for Headless is [m8c](https://github.com/laamaa/m8c), which is published by laamaa.
- The client computer will be a Raspberry Pi3 Model B+.
- For the display, we will use a third party display for the Raspberry Pi. (You can find them at [Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000380101537.html))
- We will implement MIDI IN & OUT.
- We will use the GPIO pins of the Raspberry pi to perform key emulation and try to get close to the original key layout.
- Sandwich the above various devices on two PCBs.
- If there is enough room, I would like to implement a battery module as well.

### Task1 Client and Display

---

The setup for using the m8c and Raspberry Pi can be seen in detail in the littlescale video.
[![littlescale](http://img.youtube.com/vi/CqUvGfdyEnM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqUvGfdyEnM)

Since this video shows video and audio output from the HDMI port, we will assume that audio output is available using a 3.5mm stereo jack if you use a touch display with audio output, available from [Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000380101537.html).
Or I'm thinking of getting the sound through a DAC module.

## Practical notes

- Use Headless version 2.0.5, because MIDI I/O does not work well.

### Task2 MIDI IN&OUT

---

As has been discussed several times on Dirtywave's Discord, it seems possible to implement MIDI IN and OUT in a Headless environment.
The developer, trash80, commented "MIDI in is pin 28, MIDI out is pin 1, it's enabled".
I plan to implement them as shown in the schematic below.

### Task3 Key Switch

---

Key emulation (key mapping) using the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi is also currently in the hypothetical stage.
There are plenty of people practicing something similar with the Retropi!
For the keyswitch itself, I will use the same one as the M8 original.

### Task4 Battery Module

---

I'd like to use the tiny little battery charging modules that [Aliexpress](https://ja.aliexpress.com/item/4001196670805.html) sells so that I can seamlessly connect the power supply, PSU, and charging.
I think I will agonize over where to put the batteries!
